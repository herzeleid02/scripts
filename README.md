# hello world
scripts i made. use at your own risk

now starring my best script up to date -- the "fedorapostinstall.sh" script

## fedorapostinstall.sh
Script for auto-installation of RPM Fusion repository and multimedia codecs and drivers that are fit for your hardware (also installs nvidia drivers)
The script doesnt handle any args.
